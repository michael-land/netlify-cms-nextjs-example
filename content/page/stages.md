      Warner Bros. Studio Facilities has thirty-six Sound Stages, ranging in
      size from 6,000 to 32,000 square feet located on our main lot and Ranch
      facilities. We work to accommodate the needs of our production clients and
      have added central air and support rooms to many of stages creating
      “Premium” and “Deluxe” audience stages. All of our stages have stories to
      tell from productions past and present. Stage 16, one of the tallest in
      the world with a 2,000,000 gallon water tank, was raised to its current
      height for the feature “Cain and Mabel” in 1935 and is now one of the
      favorite stages for large audience shows such as “The Voice.” Please
      contact our Studio Operations Group for availability, rates and to
      schedule a scout.
